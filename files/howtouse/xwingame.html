You are a Star Wars X-wing, and your task is to destroy the death star. 
<p>
Shoot all of the tie fighters and avoid their fire!
<p>
Every time you destroy a tie, you get closer to the Death Star's trench. 
<p><p
CONTROLS:
<ul>
<li>Left and Right arrows to move</li>
<li>Space to shoot</li>
<li>P to fire proton torpedoes into reactor</li>
</ul>
<p>

You have two wingmen, but they only have one life. You have 5. 
<p>
If you manage to make it into the trench alive, wait for the small reactor to show up. It looks like this:

<p>
Then aim for it, and press P to fire proton torpedoes. If you're too slow, you lose!
<p>
When you kill a tie, there's a 7% chance you'll get a critical hit! (double points for that kill)
<p>
If you win, you'll be given a score, and a grade. Below 60% and you lose!
