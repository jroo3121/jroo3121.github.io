Basically pong, except you can move horizontally. 
Mini squares will appear every now and then. They are powerups. 
Blue square (rare): Gives you an extra point
Pink Square (uncommon): Increases your speed for that round. 
Neon Green Square (common): Decreases your opponent's speed for that round. 
Touch the squares with your paddle and you get the powerup! But they only remain until a goal is scored. 
After a goal is scored, the round ends, and in 5 seconds, a new round will start. 
Good Luck! Have Fun!
